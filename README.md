# Projects
This repo contains all the projects I have made during my studies (not necessarily linked to computer science).
Some projects related to mechanics, electronic and computer science were conducted during my bachelor degree, but the majority have been done
during my Master. Some code can be made available on demand.

The differents reports have been placed in three different folders:
