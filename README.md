# Projects
This repo contains all the projects I have made during my studies (not necessarily linked to computer science).
Some projects related to mechanics, electronic and computer science were conducted during my bachelor degree, but the majority have been done
during my Master. Some code can be made available on demand.

The differents reports have been placed in three different folders:

## Bachelor

This folder contains some projects I have made during my frist three years (but not all of them). Most of them are written in french.

* [Mutex and semaphors ](https://github.com/Diaby02/Projects/blob/main/Bachelor/MutexAndSemaphorsProject.pdf)

This project compares the execution of multithreaded programs using POSIX semaphores and active waiting mechanisms like Test-And-Set and Test-And-Test-And-Set. It implements three classic concurrency problems: the producer-consumer, dining philosophers, and readers-writers problems. Performance measurements were conducted by varying the number of threads from 2 to 64 on a 32-core machine, showing that POSIX semaphores generally outperform active waiting mechanisms, especially as the number of threads increases.

* [C_project](https://github.com/Diaby02/Projects/blob/main/Bachelor/C_project.pdf)

This project involved translating a Python program that uses error-correcting codes into the C language and optimizing it through multithreading. The goal was to efficiently recover lost source symbols in binary file transmissions using the RLC method and to run the program on a Raspberry Pi, leveraging its four cores. The project included implementing a sequential C version, developing a multithreaded version for performance improvement, and conducting various tests to ensure functionality and efficiency.

* [Music Oz](https://github.com/Diaby02/Projects/blob/main/Bachelor/MusicUsingOZlanguage.pdf)

This project, titled "Maestroz," involves creating music using the OZ programming language and addresses known issues with handling floating-point numbers in OZ. The project includes the implementation of two extensions: smoothing to enhance sound quality by reducing noise between notes, and instruments to add a creative dimension to music composition. The implementation choices and non-declarative constructions were adjusted to meet the requirements of the Inginious platform, improving code efficiency at the cost of readability.

* [Finite Elements](https://github.com/Diaby02/Projects/blob/main/Bachelor/FiniteElementsProject.pdf)

This project focuses on studying the linear elasticity of a climbing carabiner in both open and closed positions using the finite element method. The goal is to understand how the carabiner responds to traction forces, which is crucial for ensuring the safety of climbers. The study involves modeling the mechanical behavior of the carabiner under different load conditions and using optimization techniques to ensure reasonable computation times and sufficient accuracy.

* [Morse Communication](https://github.com/Diaby02/Projects/blob/main/Bachelor/FiniteElementsProject.pdf)

This project involves developing a Morse code communication system using ultrasonic waves. The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter converts user inputs (dots, dashes, and spaces) into ultrasonic signals of specific durations, while the receiver processes these signals and converts them into visual outputs using LEDs. The project explores the design and implementation of various electronic circuits, including timers, oscillators, amplifiers, filters, and converters, to achieve reliable ultrasonic communication. Despite some challenges in the final implementation, the project provides valuable insights into electronic circuit design and the complexities of real-world applications.

* [Packets Analysis](https://github.com/Diaby02/Projects/blob/main/Bachelor/TeamsPacketsAnalysis.pdf)

This document presents an analysis of the Microsoft Teams application, focusing on its network communication protocols and security measures. The study examines DNS queries, network and transport layers, encryption techniques, and the application's behavior under various usage scenarios, such as text messaging, audio and video calls, and file sharing. The analysis reveals that Microsoft Teams primarily uses TCP for reliable data transmission and UDP for real-time audio and video communication. It also highlights the use of various security protocols like TLS and the involvement of multiple servers and domains managed by Microsoft and other service providers. The findings suggest that Microsoft Teams operates predominantly through cloud-based services, ensuring efficient and secure communication.
